Process 

Braille Text
1. Cut aluminium text panels and buttons to size using tinsnips
2. Create grid on backside of text panels
3. Stencil on a mirror image of desired braille text onto the grid created in step 2
4. Using a hammer and 3/8 steel punch create each braille bump one at a time
5. cut 7 pieces of wire, 6 inches in length
6. Strip ½ inch of each end of the 6 wires
7. attach one end of each wire to each text panel with electrical tape 


Map Construction
1. Create map box out of foam core and hot glue
2. Stencil map layout onto map box
3. Create building exterior out of half inch moulding and adhere to map with hot glue
4. Create interior walls and stair locations out of balsa wood
5. Cover surface in Plastidip (note: this process required four coats)
6. Cover each map floor in painter’s tape and spray-paint the entire map black (note: this process required two coats)
6. Scar surface of each location where a braille text panel will be installed. Carefully remove top layer of foam core beneath the location each text panel will sit. This will allow each text panel to sit flush with the surface of the map and conceal and sharp edges
7. Cut a hole in each panel location which will permit the wire from each text panel to be fed through
8. Feed the wires through the holes you just made and attach the text panels with double sided tape
9. create tactile features with a combination of push pins, adhesive felt, 5/8 wooden plugs, 1/8 tile spacers, and 100 grit sandpaper
10. Duplicate tactile features into the appropriate spot on the legend
11. cut hole to fit speaker in side of map

The Audio
1. Write voiceover scripts for each museum gallery
2. Record voiceovers and save them as mp3s
3. upload mp3s to Makey Makey Scratch Studio
4. Assign one audio file to each of the six button options
5. Add command to end current audio when next button is pushed
6. save your sketch for later use

Making it Work
1.	Attach the wire from the legend to the ground spot on the Makey Makey panel
2.	Attach each of the 6 wires to one of the 6 locations on the Makey Makey panel
3.	Sync Bluetooth speaker with laptop and install speaker in speaker slot
4.	Connect Makey Makey to laptop
5.	Open your sketch
